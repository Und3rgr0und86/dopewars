The current Chairman, Gotthold, accepts bribes from Kenshiro CyberSystems and is focused on staying in power, no matter what. Gotthold is a Bored Bureaucrat.\n \nArmed vigilante gangs make up the core of law enforcement of Victory. These gangs are very unprofessional, but are highly dedicated to protecting \“law and order\”. The police is focused on suppressing the growing \"anti-globalization\" movement, which has been implicated in assassinations. The leader of the movement is Li Wu, an Useless Boss. According to police records, Li Wu is being funded by Psychobank.\n \nThe education system in Victory focuses on economic dogma; employees can parrot meaningless slogans and recite corporate creeds by heart.\n \nVictory has a booming industrial sector, but its environmental record is horrible.")

The police is battling a group of white-collar criminals called the Embezzlers that are harming corporate profits. The leader of this group is Bronislav, an Ideological Crusader. According to police records, Bronislav is being funded by The Unguided.\n \nThe education system in Arrival specializes in the humanities; employees are experts in philosophy and ethical decision-making, but lack basic math and science skills.\n \nArrival is proud of its reputation as a source of cheap labor.
